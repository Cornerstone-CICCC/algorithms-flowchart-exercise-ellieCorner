# Exercise 1

Write an algorithm and draw a flowchart to convert the length in feet to centimeters.

## Pseudocode:

- Input length in feet (LFT)
- Calculate the length in cm (LCM) by multiplying LFT by 30
- Print length in cm (LCM)

## Code:

```plaintext
Start
Input length in feet (LFT)
LCM = LFT * 30
Print LCM
End
```

```ts
function feetToCentimeters(feet: number): number {
  return feet * 30;
}
```
