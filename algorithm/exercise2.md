# Exercise 2

Write an algorithm and draw a flowchart that will read the two sides of a rectangle and calculate its area.

## Pseudocode:

- Input the width (W) and the length (L) of a rectangle
- Calculate the area (A) by multiplying W by L
- Print A

## Code:

```plaintext
Start
Input width (W)
Input length (L)
A = W * L
Print A
End
```

```ts
function getArea(width: number, heigth: number): number {
  return width * height;
}
```
